<h1>Quiz</h1>
This website is a quiz for users who are intrested in the Preimer League to test their knowledge and are looking to enjoy a quick 2-3 minute game. There are 31 questions and each question is based on an event that has happen in each of the 31 years of Premier League Football
The top of the page I have two buttons. One being a instructions button that shows an alert quickly explaining how to play and how to get your answers. Then the other button is a restart button this is to restart the quiz either during or after the user has submitted their answers.
The user has 4 options to choose from and at the end of the quiz onces the user has clicked submit at the bottom of the button they will see how many questions out of 31 they have answered correctly. By clicking the previous button the user will be able to see what answers they got corrrect and incorrect by looking at the colour system I have added green meaning the answer is correct and red meaning its incorrect. I don't give the user the answer in order to try and get them to try the quiz again. 
At the bottom of the quiz I have asked the user for any feedback where I could improve the quiz.
