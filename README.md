<h1>Quiz</h1>
This website is a quiz for users who are interested in the Premier League to test their knowledge and are looking to enjoy a quick 2–3-minute game. There are 31 questions and each question is based on an event that has happen in each of the 31 years of Premier League Football

The top of the page I have two buttons. One being a instructions button that shows an alert quickly explaining how to play and how to get your answers. Then the other button is a restart button this is to restart the quiz either during or after the user has submitted their answers.

The user has 4 options to choose from and at the end of the quiz once the user has clicked submit at the bottom of the button they will see how many questions out of 31 they have answered correctly. By clicking the previous button the user will be able to see what answers they got correct and incorrect by looking at the colour system I have added green meaning the answer is correct and red meaning its incorrect. I don't give the user the answer in order to try and get the user to try the quiz again. 

At the bottom of the quiz I have asked the user for any feedback where I could improve the quiz.

<h1>First Time User</h1>
The website is built just like the Joe.com website. They have a format which is easy for any user to follow and that’s what I wanted to follow, nothing overtop just a simple multiple choice game which will allow the user after they have completed the game to review their answers and restart the game if they would like to.

For the future of the website and bringing people back I have included an email link where people can give me feedback. I have also thought about adding another page where I could create a new quiz and updated that monthly and base the quiz on the events of what has happened during the month of the season.

<h1>unresolved issues</h1>
When deploying my website the background image doesn't fill the screen when you use a device landscape on a mobile or tablet. Made many changes on my css page and when I inspect the website their is no issue with the responsiveness of the website however when it is deployed that’s where the issue still comes up.

<h1>Deployment</h1>h1>
The project was deployed using GitHub pages. The steps to deploy using GitHub pages are:

Go to the repository on GitHub.com

Select 'Settings' near the top of the page.

Select 'Pages' from the menu bar on the left of the page.

Under 'Source' select the 'Branch' dropdown menu and select the main branch.

Once selected, click the 'Save'.

Deployment should be confirmed by a message on a green background saying "Your site is published at" followed by the web address.
